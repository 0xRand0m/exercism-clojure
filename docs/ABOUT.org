#+TITLE: ABOUT


[[http://clojure.org][Clojure]] is a dynamic programming language that targets
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Designed as a general purpose language, Clojure
combines the approachability of a scripting language with a robust
infrastructure for multithreaded programming.

Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich
set of immutable, persistent [[http://clojure.org/data_structures][data structures]]

Clojure is open source, and information about contributing to the language
[[http://clojure.org/contributing][can be found here]]

Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, wanted a modern Lisp for functional
programming, symbiotic with the established Java platform, and designed for
concurrency; thus, clojure was born.

> Good design is not about making grand plans, but about taking things apart.

> Programming is not about typing...it's about thinking.
