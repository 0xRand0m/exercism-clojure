Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning clojure for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org/) A repository of language references and examples by function or keyword.
* [Clojure.org](http://clojure.org/) The official language website.
* [Living Clojure](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do) by Carin Meier
* [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/) by Daniel Higginbotham
