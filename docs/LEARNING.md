Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning clojure for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [ClojureDocs][]
  A repository of language references and examples by function or keyword.
* [Clojure.org][]
  The official language website.
* [Living Clojure][] by Carin Meier
* [Clojure for the Brave and True][] by Daniel Higginbotham
